ðŸ”¥ Flip-Flops in Verilog â€“ VLSI 30-Day Challenge (Day 2)
This repository contains Verilog implementations and testbenches for various Flip-Flops, including D Flip-Flop, T Flip-Flop, JK Flip-Flop, and SR Flip-Flop. These designs were simulated using Vivado 2024.2 as part of my 30-day VLSI design challenge.

ðŸ“Œ Flip-Flops Implemented
âœ” D Flip-Flop (Data Flip-Flop) â€“ Stores input at clock edge.
âœ” T Flip-Flop (Toggle Flip-Flop) â€“ Toggles output when T = 1.
âœ” JK Flip-Flop â€“ Set, Reset, Toggle, and Hold functionality.
âœ” SR Flip-Flop â€“ Set and Reset controlled storage.

ðŸš€ Tools Used
Vivado 2024.2 â€“ For simulation and debugging.
Verilog â€“ For hardware description

ðŸ›  Simulation & Testing
To run the simulation in Vivado:

Clone the repository
Open Vivado 2024.2
Add Verilog files & testbench
Run behavioral simulation
Observe waveforms

âš¡ Key Learnings
Flip-Flops are essential for sequential circuits and memory storage.
Proper initialization & reset logic prevents undefined states (X).
Testing & debugging are crucial in hardware design!
